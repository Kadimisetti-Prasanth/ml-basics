P-value or probability value concept is used everywhere in the statistical analysis. It determines the statistical significance and the measure of significance testing. 
P-value is known as the level of marginal significance within the hypothesis testing that represents the probability of occurrence of the given event. The P-value is used as an alternative to the rejection point to provide the least significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. If the P-value is small, then there is stronger evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis.
if 
P-value ≤ 0.05    -> It indicates the null hypothesis is very unlikely  ->hypothesis interpretation is Rejected
P-value > 0.05    -> It indicates the null hypothesis is very likely.  -> Accepted or it “fails to reject”.
P-value > 0.05    -> The P-value is near the cut-off. It is considered as marginal ->The hypothesis needs more attention.
